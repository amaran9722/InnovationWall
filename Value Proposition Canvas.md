# Value Proposition Canvas

The Value Proposition Canvas has two sides. With the **Customer Profile** (p. 10), you clarify your customer understanding. With the **Value Map** (p. 26), you describe how you intend to create value for that customer. You achieve **Fit** (p. 40) between the two when one meets the other.

## Value Map

The Value (Proposition) Map describes the features of a specific value proposition in your business model in a more structured and detailed way. It breaks your value proposition down into products and services, pain relievers, and gain creators.

- **Products and Services**: This is a list of all the products and services a value proposition is built around.
- **Pain Relievers**: Describe how your products and services alleviate customer pains.
- **Gain Creators**: Describe how your products and services create customer gains.

## Customer Profile

The Customer (Segment) Profile describes a specific customer segment in your business model in a more structured and detailed way. It breaks the customer down into jobs, pains, and gains.

- **Customer Jobs**: Describe what customers are trying to get done in their work and in their lives, as expressed in their own words.
- **Pains**: Describe bad outcomes, risks, and obstacles related to customer jobs.
- **Gains**: Describe the outcomes customers want to achieve or the concrete benefits they are seeking.

## Fit

You achieve **Fit** when your value map meets your customer profile—when your products and services produce pain relievers and gain creators that match one or more of the jobs, pains, and gains that are important to your customer.

### Customer Jobs

Jobs describe the things your customers are trying to get done in their work or in their life. A customer job could be the tasks they are trying to perform and complete, the problems they are trying to solve, or the needs they are trying to satisfy. Make sure you take the customer’s perspective when investigating jobs. What you think of as important from your perspective might not be a job customers are actually trying to get done.

Distinguish between three main types of customer jobs to be done and supporting jobs:

- **Functional Jobs**  
  When your customers try to perform or complete a specific task or solve a specific problem, for example, mow the lawn, eat healthy as a consumer, write a report, or help clients as a professional.

- **Social Jobs**  
  When your customers want to look good or gain power or status. These jobs describe how customers want to be perceived by others, for example, look trendy as a consumer or be perceived as competent as a professional.

- **Personal/Emotional Jobs**  
  When your customers seek a specific emotional state, such as feeling good or secure, for example, seeking peace of mind regarding one’s investments as a consumer or achieving the feeling of job security at one’s workplace.

**Supporting Jobs**  
Customers also perform supporting jobs in the context of purchasing and consuming value either as consumers or as professionals. These jobs arise from three different roles:

- **Buyer of Value**: Jobs related to buying value, such as comparing offers, deciding which products to buy, standing in a checkout line, completing a purchase, or taking delivery of a product or service.
- **Cocreator of Value**: Jobs related to cocreating value with your organization, such as posting product reviews and feedback or even participating in the design of a product or service.
- **Transferrer of Value**: Jobs related to the end of a value proposition’s life cycle, such as canceling a subscription, disposing of a product, transferring it to others, or reselling it.

**Job Context**  
Customer jobs often depend on the specific context in which they are performed. The context may impose certain constraints or limitations. For example, calling somebody on the fly is different when you are traveling on a train than when you are driving a car. Likewise, going to the movies with your kids is different than going with your partner.

**Job Importance**  
It is important to acknowledge that not all jobs have the same importance to your customer. Some matter more in a customer’s work or life because failing to get them done could have serious ramifications. Some are insignificant because the customer cares about other things more. Sometimes a customer will deem a job crucial because it occurs frequently or because it will result in a desired or unwanted outcome.

### Customer Gains

Gains describe the outcomes and benefits your customers want. Some gains are required, expected, or desired by customers, and some would surprise them. Gains include functional utility, social gains, positive emotions, and cost savings.

Seek to identify four types of customer gains in terms of outcomes and benefits:

- **Required Gains**  
  These are gains without which a solution wouldn’t work. For example, the most basic expectation that we have from a smartphone is that we can make a call with it.

- **Expected Gains**  
  These are relatively basic gains that we expect from a solution, even if it could work without them. For example, since Apple launched the iPhone, we expect phones to be well-designed and look good.

- **Desired Gains**  
  These are gains that go beyond what we expect from a solution but would love to have if we could. These are usually gains that customers would come up with if you asked them. For example, we desire smartphones to be seamlessly integrated with our other devices.

- **Unexpected Gains**  
  These are gains that go beyond customer expectations and desires. They wouldn’t even come up with them if you asked them. Before Apple brought touch screens and the App Store to the mainstream, nobody really thought of them as part of a phone.

**Gain Relevance**  
A customer gain can feel essential or nice to have, just like pains can feel extreme or moderate to them.

**Tip: Make Gains Concrete**  
As with pains, it’s better to describe gains as concretely as possible to clearly differentiate jobs, pains, and gains from one another. Ask how much they’d expect or dream of when a customer indicates “better performance” as a desired gain. That way you can note “would love an increased performance of more than X.” When you understand how exactly customers measure gains (i.e., outcomes and benefits), you can design better gain creators in your value proposition.

**Trigger Questions for Gains**:
- Which savings would make your customers happy? Which savings in terms of time, money, and effort would they value?
- What quality levels do they expect, and what would they wish for more or less of?
- How do current value propositions delight your customers? Which specific features do they enjoy? What performance and quality do they expect?
- What would make your customers’ jobs or lives easier? Could there be a flatter learning curve, more services, or lower costs of ownership?
- What positive social consequences do your customers desire? What makes them look good? What increases their power or their status?
- What are customers looking for most? Are they searching for good design, guarantees, specific or more features?
- What do customers dream about? What do they aspire to achieve, or what would be a big relief to them?
- How do your customers measure success and failure? How do they gauge performance or cost?
- What would increase your customers’ likelihood of adopting a value proposition? Do they desire lower cost, less investment, lower risk, or better quality?

**Profile of a "Business Book Reader"**  
We chose to use potential readers of this book to illustrate the customer profile. We deliberately went beyond jobs, pains, and gains merely related to reading books, since we intended to design an innovative and more holistic value proposition for businesspeople in general.

The customer profile sketched out on the right is informed by several interviews we conducted and thousands of interactions we had with workshop participants. However, it is not mandatory to start with preexisting customer knowledge. You may begin exploring ideas by sketching out a profile based on what you believe your potential customers look like. This is an excellent starting point to prepare customer interviews and tests regarding your assumptions about customer jobs, pains, and gains.
